Run 'npm install'\r\n3. Copy config.sample.js to config.js\r\n4. Modify to add in your keys (instructions for finding keys in the file)\r\n\r\n# Running\r\nRun 'node index.js'. Because this needs to read from stdin, it can't be amped off, disowned, or forever'd (although do this at your own risk once you have a refresh token).\r\n\r\nThe best way to get this running in the background is to run `screen` before `node index.js`, and then hit `Ctrl + A + D` to detach the session. Then you can exit out of your ssh session, or close the terminal, and it should keep running.\r\n",
